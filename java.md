### Reactive programming
Reactive Programming is design pattern that focuses on using async and non blocking data streams to handle data and events. 


 Abstraction 
Hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user 

#### Abstract class
To achive Abstraction we use abstract class but it it partial abstraction 

#### interfaces
 interfaces are blueprints, they define methods but not the implementation. helpfull in Multiple inheritance, clear contracts

### spirng boot 

module of spring framework enalbes for rapid applaiction developement 
by simpliying configuration, setup process, dependency management, embeded server (tomcat, jetty, netty)


### starter projects 
spring boot starter web, spring boot starter webflux, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, spring-boot-starter-test, spring-boot-starter-acutator 

### why spring boot over spring 
easy to use , rapid application developement , auto configuration ,dependency management, embeded server


### annoatations 
SpringBootAppliaciton, Configuration, ComponentScan, EnableAutoConfiguration, 

#### @Component
mark a class as spring bean, which can be managed by spring container ConfigurationApplicationContext  

#### @Autowired
automatically inject dependencys of one class into another class 

#### @Service
mark a class as a service component to write some business logic 

#### @RestController (includes @Controller @ResponceBody )
to create REST API we use RestController annotation so it can return json responces to that endpoints.

#### @Controller 

#### RequestMapping
#### Repository 
DB Logic 

#### thymeleaf 
java service side template engine 


### IOC  inversion of control
manages ojbjects in spring 

### bean
simple plane java object in spring tearm which is managed by spring container(IOC Container) 

### spring bean lifecycle 

container start --> bean create --> dependency create --> dependency inject --> destroy
