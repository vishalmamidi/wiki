# Java 8 Features - Questions and Answers

## Q1: What is the purpose of Lambda Expressions in Java 8?
**A:** Lambda Expressions provide a clear and concise way to represent a single method interface using an expression. They enable functional programming and reduce boilerplate code.

---

## Q2: What is a Functional Interface in Java 8?
**A:** A Functional Interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method. It can be represented using a lambda expression. Examples include `Runnable`, `Callable`, and `Comparator`.

---

## Q3: What is the Stream API in Java 8?
**A:** The Stream API is used to process collections of data in a functional style. It supports operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing, making it easier to work with collections.

---

## Q4: What is the purpose of the `Optional` class in Java 8?
**A:** The `Optional` class is used to handle null values gracefully and avoid `NullPointerException`. It provides methods like `isPresent()`, `orElse()`, and `ifPresent()`.

---

## Q5: What are Default Methods in Java 8?
**A:** Default Methods allow interfaces to have method implementations. This helps in adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

---

## Q6: What is the new Date and Time API in Java 8?
**A:** Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API in the `java.time` package. It provides classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `LocalDateTime` for easier and more robust date-time manipulation.

---

## Q7: What is the purpose of the `forEach` method in Java 8?
**A:** The `forEach` method is used to iterate over elements in a collection. It is a part of the `Iterable` interface and is often used with lambda expressions.

---

## Q8: What are Method References in Java 8?
**A:** Method References are a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. They are represented using the `::` operator.

---

## Q9: What is the significance of the `Collectors` class in Java 8?
**A:** The `Collectors` class provides utility methods for collecting stream elements into collections like lists, sets, or maps. It also supports aggregation operations like grouping and partitioning.

---

## Q10: What are the main benefits of Java 8 features?
**A:** Java 8 features improve code readability, enable functional programming, reduce boilerplate code, and provide better tools for handling collections and date-time operations.
