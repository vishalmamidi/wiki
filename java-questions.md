### Q: What is an interface in Java?
**A**: An interface is a blueprint with abstract methods and constants. It achieves full abstraction and supports multiple inheritance.

### Q: What are the key features of an interface?
**A**: Methods are `public abstract`, and fields are `public static final`.

### Q: What is an abstract class in Java?
**A**: An abstract class is a class that can have both abstract and concrete methods. It provides shared functionality and partial abstraction.

### Q: What are the key features of an abstract class?
**A**: It can have constructors, fields, and methods with any access modifier.

### Q: When should you use an interface?
**A**: Use an interface for unrelated classes or when multiple inheritance is needed.

### Q: When should you use an abstract class?
**A**: Use an abstract class for related classes with shared behavior.

### Q: What is the purpose of an interface?
**A**: An interface defines a contract.

### Q: What is the purpose of an abstract class?
**A**: An abstract class provides a base with shared structure.

### Q: Can we achieve full abstraction with abstract classes by adding only abstract methods?
**A**: Technically, yes. Generally we dont do because main reason to use an abstract class to provide some common implementation (concrete methods)
